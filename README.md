# Generating a Rails API-only

Steps i used to generate this simple API:

* Created a directory called API-TRIAL-1

* Used 2 flags (--api and --minimal) they helped me to get rid of files i didn't need in my api

* Generating route file, controller, model to interact with the database and migration to generate the corresponding database table for this model

* To generate all those all together i used RESOURCE GENERATOR (amazing yeeeh!!! i know you should try it)

* Created my seed files

* Running my API
